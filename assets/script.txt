Hello everyone! Welcome to my Youtube channel.

Today I'm going to talk about green economy and how it is related to sustainable development.

First of all, let's define what green economy is. Green economy is an economy that prioritizes the use of renewable resources and energy sources, and seeks to reduce environmental impact through efficient use of resources, waste reduction, and pollution prevention.

Now let's see how green economy is related to sustainable development. Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. So, green economy is an important part of sustainable development because it focuses on efficient use of natural resources and energy sources, and reduces environmental impact.

Finally, let's look at some of the ways we can practice green economy in our daily life. We can start by reducing the amount of energy and resources we use on a daily basis. We can also opt for renewable sources of energy, like solar, wind, and geothermal. We can also practice waste reduction by recycling and composting our waste.

I hope this video was helpful in understanding the importance of green economy and how it is related to sustainable development. Thanks for watching!
