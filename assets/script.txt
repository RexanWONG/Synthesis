Hello everyone! Welcome to my Youtube video about the brawler Mortis in Brawl Stars! 

Mortis is an undead chicken who loves to fight! He is a Super Rare brawler with an interesting playstyle. His main attack is a powerful charge that deals heavy damage and knocks back enemies. He can also shoot a spread of spooky shots that drain the life of his enemies.

But what really sets Mortis apart is his Super Ability. He creates a powerful vortex that sucks enemies in and does massive damage. It's great for clearing out a crowded area or taking out a pesky enemy hiding in the corner. 

Now, let's talk about Mortis's stats. He has moderate health and damage, but his main strength lies in his movement speed. He can quickly close the gap between him and his enemies, making him great for surprise attacks and ambush tactics.

So that's Mortis in a nutshell! He's a fun Super Rare brawler that can be used in a variety of ways. If you're looking for a brawler that can surprise your enemies and deal heavy damage, then Mortis is the one for you!
